&nbsp;

---
## Git Basics:
- __Introduction to Git and GitHub (2 week)__ [link to a course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github)
>The course is awesome. I love the teaching pace of the tutor. The videos are short and informative with enough content. Short question during the lecture videos makes me alert and in fact makes me to go back and check the information again. Cheet sheets are given in every section of every week. Graded assignments are helpful, informative and covers all the contents covered in the week.

&nbsp;
- __Learngitbranching__ [link to a course](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
>The content was excellent. Branches, merging and other things were visualized and interactive. Here I completed exciting levels, watched step-by-step instruction on how to use Git powerful features. This course helped me better imagine the work of Git.

\
*Сonclusion: I 've learned a lot of new things about Git that I'd never known before.*

## Linux CLI, and HTTP:
- __Linux Survival (4 modules)__ [link to a course](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/)

>New thing: this course was extremely useful, because I have never used Linux before, I only knew the cd, ls commands.

>The thing that surprised me: File Security, File Permission, Redirecting output. Also it was especially interesting to practice checking processes and closing them through the "ps aux" command line.

>Things I'm going to use in the future: I think I'll definitely use these: cat, ls, mv, find, grep, kill, man, cd, mkdir, chmod, cp, rm, rmdir.

*Сonclusion: really good online Linux lessons - they are interactive!*
