>The course is awesome. I love the teaching pace of the tutor. The videos are short and informative with enough content.

Graded assignments are helpful, informative and covers all the contents covered in the week.

Classic Frogger Game:
[DEMO](https://martthaa.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) | [CODE BASE](https://github.com/martthaa/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

I learned a lot about:

- Closures;
- this keyword;
- Object Decorator Pattern;
- Functional Classes;
- Prototypal Classes;
- Pseudoclassical Patterns;

I completed frogger game. It was difficult and unobvious task for me.

I returned to codewars service after a long period. Now I am better prepared to solve tasks (katas) and achieved new levels (kuys). I plan to continue the task solving at this service at future.
